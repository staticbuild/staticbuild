# staticbuild demo site - jade+nunjucks

Although it is possible to use jade+nunjucks simultaneously in the same 
project at the time of this writing, a demo hasn't been created yet.

This could be useful if you plan to use one templating engine for HTML and 
another for some other type of text output. Jade is a good engine for HTML,
but nunjucks can be used to output any type of text. For instance, markdown 
files could be generated with nunjucks.
